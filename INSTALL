1.) Python library path

In order to run all apps, you have to add the pylib library to the Python
library path.

Ubuntu:
add the line

  export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/pylib/lib
  
to the file "~/.bashrc". Change the path correspondingly. Please note that
"/path/to/pylib" is the path to your copy of pylib, and the traling "/lib"
is the lib-folder inside pylib.


EXAMPLE:

  export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:~/git/ahoi/pylib/lib)

Here, pylib is located at "git/ahoi/pylib" inside the user's home folder.




2.) Python lib dependencies:

pylib makes use of the third-party libraries listed in "requirements.txt",
which have to be installed separately. Depending on your system and
configuration, you may use the system's tools for installation or PIP by
running

  pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt 

Since pylib is based on Python 3, make sure that you install the library
for this version of Python. In above example, this is ensured by using
"pip3".

If you plan to use the image transmission app, additional libraries have
to be installed. Please edit the file "requirements.txt" in this case by
commenting in the relevant part. 



3.) Access to serial devices

Under Linux, please ensure that your user account is member of the group
"dialout". You can check this by typing

  groups

on a terminal / in a command line window. If dialout does not show up in
the produced list, you have to add yourself to this group:

  sudo usermod -a -G dialout yourUserName

where you must replace yourUserName by your user name. Please note that
you need sudo/administrator rights for this action to succeed.

After completion, please log out and in again to make the change effective.
