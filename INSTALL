1.) Python library path

in order to run all apps, you have to add the pylib library to the Python library path.

Ubuntu:
add the line

export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/pylib/

(example: export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:~/git/ahoi/pylib/lib)
  
to the file "~/.bashrc". Change the path correspondingly.



2.) Python lib dependencies:

- pylib makes use of the following third-party libraries, which have to be installed separately
argparse
configparser
dataclasses
imageviewer
picamera
pygame
Pillow
readline
RPi
