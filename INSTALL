1.) Python library path

in order to run all apps, you have to add the pylib library to the Python library path.

Ubuntu:
add the line

export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/pylib/lib

(example: export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:~/git/ahoi/pylib/lib)
  
to the file "~/.bashrc". Change the path correspondingly.



2.) Python lib dependencies:

- pylib makes use of the third-party libraries listed in "requirements.txt", which have to be installed separately. Depending on your system and configuration, you may use the system's tools
for installation or pip by running

  pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
