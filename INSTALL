1.) Python

Pylib has been developed for and under Python 3.x. It has been tested with
Python 3.7 and 3.8 and we recommended using the latest version of Python 
on Windows machines or the one that comes with your distribution on Linux.

For Ubuntu, run

  sudo apt install python3 
  sudo apt install python3-pip  optional
  
For Windows (10), go to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and
download the latest stable release (e.g., Python 3.8.1 from Dec. 18, 2019).
Make sure that you tick the box during installation that adds Python to
your system path.
Current releases of Python for Windows contain PIP already. You wil need
PIP to install additional libraries that are required by pylib.



2.) Setup Python to find pylib

In order to run all apps from pylib, you have to add the pylib library to
the Python library path.

For Linux, add the line

  export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/pylib/lib
  
to the file "~/.bashrc". Change the path correspondingly. Please note that
"/path/to/pylib" is the path to your copy of pylib, and the traling "/lib"
is the lib-folder inside pylib.

EXAMPLE:

  export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:~/git/ahoi/pylib/lib)

Here, pylib is located at "git/ahoi/pylib" inside the user's home folder.

For Windows (10), go to system settings by the key combination "Win+Pause".
Select "Advanced system settings" on the left of the opened window. Click
the button "Environment Variables" at the very bottom and add the sytem
environment variable PYTHONPATH with value

  %PYTHONPATH%;C:\Users\You\path\to\pylib\lib
  
You have to replace the portion after the semicolon with the correct path
to your pylib folder.



3.) Python lib dependencies:

pylib makes use of the third-party libraries listed in "requirements.txt",
which have to be installed separately. Depending on your system and
configuration, you may use the system's tools for installation or PIP by
running

  pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt 
  
In both Windows and Linux, this is done by opening a terminal/command line
window and running above comments from within the folder, in which pylib
resides.

Since pylib is based on Python 3, make sure that you install the library
for this version of Python. In above example, this is ensured by using
"pip3".

If you plan to use the image transmission app, additional libraries have
to be installed. Please edit the file "requirements.txt" in this case by
commenting in the relevant part.



4.) Access to serial devices (Linux only)

Under Linux, please ensure that your user account is member of the group
"dialout". You can check this by typing

  groups

on a terminal / in a command line window. If dialout does not show up in
the produced list, you have to add yourself to this group:

  sudo usermod -a -G dialout yourUserName

where you must replace yourUserName by your user name. Please note that
you need sudo/administrator rights for this action to succeed.

After completion, please log out and in again to make the change effective.



5.) Running pylib apps and selecting a serial port

You should now be able to run any pylib apps by navigating into the
corresponding folder and executing the script. Most scripts will
prompt you with a selection of the serial port, to which you modem
is connected. It is also possible to provide the port as command line
argument.
